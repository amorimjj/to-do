description: Rules to agents
globs: **/*
---

When creating a new agent rule, project-specific information should be added to a new file in `.cursor/rules/` without modifying existing rules. Avoid repetition and reorganize sections for clarity and flow. This includes subagent customizations for this particular repository.

Subagent customizations that are general in nature should be made directly to `.cursor/subagents/*.md`.

When customizing rules and commands, do not repeat yourself. Prefer a single, well-considered and exact directive per concept.

Do not cross-reference rules in other files; assume they are all loaded and available simultaneously.
